# Team Log for GSND 5110 GP3, _"The Duo"_

Because there are only two members in our group (Nianyi & Sadaf), it is unnecessary to write down the attendees of each meeting.

## Post-class Meeting: Brainstorming - 10/28/2024

This is the first day of GP3.
We formed up a group in the class, but sadly we couldn't get any more teammates because everyone's got their groups already.
We were a bit worried if it was because we were infamous or we just happened to be unlucky.

We tried to brainstorm on any doable idea for this GP.
In the end, we decided to further develop the overpass idea written in [my blog](http://wangnianyi2001.com/blog/the-art-of-game-design-book-note-1/).
But there are two versions: I prefer the first one while Sadaf prefer the second one.
So we decided to go home and write some words on each other's prefered ideas, then we'll pick one.

## In-class Meeting \#1 - 11/04/2024

We decided to go for the second version.

There was a surprising pitching session.
Neither of us knew this was coming, so we had to prepare for it hurrily while other groups are presenting.
Luckily, we got enough time, and the pitching was not too broken?

## Jam Session \#1 - 11/07/2024

We went to Snell and worked together for an entire afternoon to build a minimal playable whitebox prototype.
It went smoothly; we actually achieved the goal by the end of the day.
